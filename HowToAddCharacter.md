# How to Add an Character

To add an Character, follow these steps:

1. **Create Character Skin**:
   - First, create a skin for the character by creating a file in the `Json/Client/Entities` directory.

2. **Define Character Properties**:
   - Inside the file, define the Character properties using a JSON format. For example, you can use the `basiccharacter.json` template.

   Example `basiccharacter.json`:
   ```json
   {
    "name": "CharacterA",
    "transform": {
        "scale": {
            "x": 1,
            "y": 1
        }
    },
    "plugins": [
        {
            "name": "PrintablePlugin",
            "type": "sprite",
            "texture": {
                "path": "./Assets/Ally/vessel.gif"
            },
            "zIndex": -1,
            "textureRect": {
                "x": 0,
                "y": 34,
                "width": 32,
                "height": 16
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "PhysicsPlugin",
            "isOverlap": true,
            "boxes": []
        },
        {
            "name": "Animation",
            "animations": [
                {
                    "name": "idle",
                    "time": 0.1,
                    "frames": [
                        {

                            "y": 34,
                            "width": 32,
                            "height": 16
                        },

   ### Now, you have successfully added an character to your game!
